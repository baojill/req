/**
 * Summary of `ReactBrowserEventEmitter` event handling:
 *
 *  - Top-level delegation is used to trap most native browser events. This
 *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of
 *    ReactEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support pluggable
 *    event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.
 *
 *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This
 *    may be done in the worker thread.
 *
 *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to
 *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want
 *    to extract any synthetic events.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with
 *    "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.
 *
